# Experiments for Evaluating Discrete Latent Temporal Structure

This repository provides code to run experiments from,
 
**Learning Procedural Abstractions and Evaluating Discrete Latent Temporal Structure**  
Karan Goel and Emma Brunskill  
_ICLR 2019_

Specifically, this repository reproduces experiments with the new evaluation criteria proposed in the paper. 
The results are reproduced from logged runs of the methods being compared (stored in ``logs/``).

For instance, running   

``> python evaluate.py --dataset bees_0``
  
will reproduce all the plots and visualizations from the first sequence of the Bees dataset in plots/. Some
of these are included in the ICLR submission.
